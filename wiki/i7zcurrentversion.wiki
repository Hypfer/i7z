#summary Talks about the function of appending (single socket code only) and temperature measurement in i7z-0.26

= Logging Functions =

Logging can be done via calling i7z with

*sudo ./i7z -w a*

appends the frequencies of the cores in a file.

*sudo ./i7z -w l*

overwrites the frequencies of the cores in a file. just the latest measurement


= Temperature =

Temperature is counted by observing the MSR for Tj (temperature junction) and the digital readout

Then, Temp =  Tj - digital readout

= SVN version and >= ver 0.27 features =

Updated to support additional functions

Help menu via : `./i7z -h` OR `./i7z --help`

Append to a log file:  `./i7z --write a` OR `./i7z -w a`

Replacement instead of Append:  `./i7z --write l` OR `./i7z -w l`

Default log file name is cpu_freq_log.txt (single socket) or cpu_freq_log_dual_%d.txt (dual socket)

Specifying a different log file: `./i7z --logfile filename` OR `./i7z -l filename`

Specifying a particular socket to print: `./i7z --socket0 X`  where X = 0, 1...

In order to print to a second socket use: `./i7z --socket1 X`  where X = 0, 1...

To turn the ncurses GUI off use: `./i7z --nogui`

Example: To print for two sockets and also change the log file `./i7z --socket0 0 --socket1 1 -logfile /tmp/logfilei7z -w l`
