#summary Talks about the function of appending (single socket code only) and temperature measurement in i7z-0.26

= Logging Functions =

Logging can be done via calling i7z with

*sudo ./i7z -w a*

appends the frequencies of the cores in a file.

*sudo ./i7z -w l*

overwrites the frequencies of the cores in a file. just the latest measurement


= Temperature =

Temperature is counted by observing the MSR for Tj (temperature junction) and the digital readout

Then, Temp =  Tj - digital readout
