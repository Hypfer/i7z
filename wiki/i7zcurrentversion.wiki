#summary Talks about the function of appending (single socket code only) and temperature measurement in i7z-0.26

= Logging Functions =

Logging can be done via calling i7z with

*sudo ./i7z -w a*

appends the frequencies of the cores in a file.

*sudo ./i7z -w l*

overwrites the frequencies of the cores in a file. just the latest measurement


= Temperature =

Temperature is counted by observing the MSR for Tj (temperature junction) and the digital readout

Then, Temp =  Tj - digital readout

= SVN version and >= ver 0.27 features =

Updated to support additional functions

Help menu via : `./i7z -h` OR `./i7z --help`

Append to a log file (freq is always logged when logging is enabled, no way to disable freq logging [yet] ):  `./i7z --write a` OR `./i7z -w a`

Replacement instead of Append:  `./i7z --write l` OR `./i7z -w l`

(Enabling) Log the temperature (also needs the -w a or -w l option): `./i7z --logtemp` OR `./i7z -t`

(Enabling) Log the C-states (also needs the -w a or -w l option): `./i7z --logcstate` OR `./i7z -c`

LOGGING DEFAULTS:
(ENABLED by default when logging is enable) Default (freq) log file name is cpu_freq_log.txt (single socket) or cpu_freq_log_dual_%d.txt (dual socket)

(DISABLED by default) Default temp log file name is cpu_temp_log.txt (single socket) or cpu_temp_log_dual_%d.txt (dual socket)

(DISABLED by default) Default cstate log file name is cpu_cstate_log.txt (single socket) or cpu_cstate_log_dual_%d.txt (dual socket)

Specifying a different (freq) log file: `./i7z --logfile filename` OR `./i7z -l filename`

Specifying a different temperature log file: `./i7z --templogfile filename` [OR] `./i7z -x filename`

Specifying a different cstate log file: `./i7z --cstatelogfile filename` [OR] `./i7z -p filename`

Specifying a particular socket to print: `./i7z --socket0 X`  where X = 0, 1...

In order to print to a second socket use: `./i7z --socket1 X`  where X = 0, 1...

To turn the ncurses GUI off use: `./i7z --nogui`

Example: To print for two sockets and also change the log file `./i7z --socket0 0 --socket1 1 -logfile /tmp/logfilei7z -w l`
